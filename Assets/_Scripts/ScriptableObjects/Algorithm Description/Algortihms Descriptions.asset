      Choose unvisited neighbour at random\n\t\t- Make connection between current
      node and its selected neighbour\n\t\t- Push this neighbour to the stack and
      return to step 2"

      no unvisited neighbours:\n\t- Start scanning from the scanning starting position,\n\t\t-
      If current node was visited, set scanning starting position to current node\n\t\t-
      If current node was not visited and it has visited neighbour:\n\t\t\t- Make
      connection between current node and this neightbour\n\t\t\t- Return to step
